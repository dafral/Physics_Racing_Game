#WELCOME TO SUPER PHYSICS 64

##Will you be able to finish this crazy car racing game?

###How to play/win?
In order to win you have to finish two laps. How do you finish a lap? It's easy, you only have to touch all the checkpoints in order. The next 
check point will be marked with a red huge laser. Go for it and touch it and the next will appear. If you die or you press "R"(respawn) you will appear in 
last checkpoint you touched. Try to finish the two laps in the less time possible!

Oh, and don't try to cheat jumping to the low area if you haven't finished the higher part of the level first, or you will die. :^)
